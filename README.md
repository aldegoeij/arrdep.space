The Arrivals and Departures Board for Space Missions :)

This is the _open-source_ repo for https://arrdep.space, please fork and PR to help us build out to become the center of space mission arrival and departure data.

The aim is to have the site and board up on arrdep.space and the data feed availabe via api.arrdep.space, all built with AWS Amplify and hosted on AWS CloudFront & S3 :muscle: :cloud:
