## Data API

We fully intend to make all landings and launches to and from space that you can find on our
arrivals and departures board available via API for reuse in your apps and solutions.

However, at the moment we are still building and testing the API, so check back soon, or reach out
on [Twitter DM](https://twitter.com/messages/compose?recipient_id=1358400277964083204) if you are
really, really interested ;)

export default ({ children, meta }) => (
  <Layout title={meta.title} description={meta.description} keywords={["data", "api"]}>
    <h1>{meta.title}</h1>
    <h4>{meta.subTitle}</h4>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    {children}
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
  </Layout>
)
